### View Issues

#### Common View Errors

1. **View Not Found Error**
```
Error: View [admin.content.pages.index] not found.
```

**Solutions:**
- Check view file path matches the dot notation:
```
admin.content.pages.index → resources/views/admin/content/pages/index.blade.php
```

- Verify directory structure:
```
resources/
  └── views/
      └── admin/
          └── content/
              └── pages/
                  └── index.blade.php
```

- Common causes and fixes:
  1. Missing file extension: Ensure `.blade.php` extension
  2. Wrong directory structure: Match dot notation exactly
  3. Case sensitivity: Check folder and file names match exactly
  4. Missing view file: Create the required view file
  5. Wrong view name in controller: Verify return view('admin.content.pages.index')

**Quick Fix Commands:**
```bash
# Create missing directories
mkdir -p resources/views/admin/content/pages

# Create view file
touch resources/views/admin/content/pages/index.blade.php

# Verify view exists
php artisan view:list | grep admin.content.pages.index
```

**Best Practices:**
- Keep view names lowercase
- Use kebab-case for file names
- Follow directory structure that matches route hierarchy
- Use view composers for shared data
- Implement proper view inheritance
